Assignment for interview process

Before starting to solve the problem, I did some research for the best seats to sit in at a movie theater and found that the best seats are 2/3 of the way back and from there, it was better to move rows ahead than it was to go back rows.

Assumptions:
  - Customers prioritize row they sit in more than their actual seats starting with the row that is 2/3 rows away from the screen. 
  - Customers would rather sit together at a different showing instead of sitting separately at the same showing unless there are more people in the reservation than seats in a row.

Instructions:
  1. Download theatre.java file.
  2. Open command line and compile Theatre.java within the correct directory using "javac Theater.java"
  3. Run the program following this format: "java Theater fileLocation"
  4. Read output.txt file that will be created in the same directory as the Theatre.java file.
    a. The output.txt file will have each reservations seats and if there are not enough adjacent seats for a reservation, there will be a        message instead of seats next to the reservation number.
